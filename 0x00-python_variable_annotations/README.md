# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
In this project I will be learning how to write *type hints a.k.a type annotations* that where introduced in [PEP 484]('https://peps.python.org/pep-0484').\

Annotations aim to improve the readability and understanding of source code and are interpreted by third-party libraries to provide effective and time-saving services such as syntax hints,
data type checking, data type hinting in IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments auto-completion of code, and automated or AI-driven documentation generation.
There are two types of annotations in Python: function annotations and variable annotations. I will learn to implement both types in this projects tasks.
