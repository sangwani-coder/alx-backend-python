# Python - Async
## Learning Objectives

- async and await syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module


## Tasks:
* **0. The basics of Async**
[0-basic_async_syntax.py](./0-basic_async_syntax.py): Defines an asynchronous coroutine that takes in an integer argument
(max_delay, with a default value of 10) named wait_random that waits for a random delay between 0 and max_delay (included and float value)
seconds and eventually returns it.
- Generate a Random floating point number using:
**random.uniform(start, stop)**
